    <h1>Analyzing Architecure</h1>
    <div class="">
      <h2>Structural Decay</h2>
      <p>Contineoual analsis of architectural vitality to say, business is changed, technology changes. Are the archtectures that we have currently in place,
         suitable for the kids of load and requests and the kind of business we are doing?.</p>
      <p>The structure refers to the architecture style that your application built with, to support the architectural characteristics (lities).
        Are we deterioarating these characteristics that must be supported irrespective of the functionality and load?
      <h4>Analyzing Components (building block) :</h4>
      <p>communication and coupling levels between the components needs to be analyzed.</p>

      <h4>Macro techniques:</h4>
        Static coupling:
        <p>
          Afferent coupling (who talks to me?), Efferent coupling (who am I dependent?) <br>
          Every one of the components that I talk to forms a coupling level between those components which starts tearing down all these kind of -ilities.
        </p>
        Temporal coupling:
        <p>
          Runtime coupling between the components. It is dangerous, no tool exists to analyze.<br>
        </p>
        Component size
      </ul>
    </div>

    <div class="">
      <h4>Analyzing Microservices</h4>
      <p>
      Shared Libraries <br>
      Too much interservice communication: <em>If it is too much, better to move back to monolith.</em> <br>
      Microservice orchestrator <br>
      Too many aggegation requests <br>
      Periodic Async processes <br>
      </p>
