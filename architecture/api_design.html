        <h2>Top 6 Architectural Styles</h2>
        <ul>
            <li><i>SOAP (Simple Object Access Protocol)</i>: <br>Use SOAP when you need a strict, standardized protocol for exchanging structured information in enterprise-level applications. It's known for its strong typing and security features.</li>
            <li><i>RESTful (Representational State Transfer)</i>: <br>
                REST is great for webservices that prioritize simplicity and scalability. Use it when building public-facing APIs of when you want a stateless, resource-oriented design.
            </li>
            <li>
                <i>GraphQL</i>: <br>
                GraphQL is perfect when you need flexible, client-driven APIs. It allows clients to request exacly the data they need, reducing over-fetching and under-fetching.
            </li>
            <li>
                <i>gRPC</i>: <br>
                If you're aiming for high-performance, efficient APIs, gRPC is your go-to. It's designed for low-latency, high-throughput communication, often used in microservices architectures.
            </li>
            <li>
                <i>WebSocket</i>: <br>
                When real-time, bidirectional communication is essential (eg: chat applications, online gaming), WebSockets shine. They maintain a contineous connection for instant data updates.
            </li>
            <li>
                <i>Webhooks</i>: <br>
                Use webhooks for even-driven systems. They allow your application to recieve notifications or trigger actions when specific events occur, such as data updates or user actions.
            </li>
        </ul>
