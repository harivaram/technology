    <h1>Application Performance</h1>


    <div class="">
      <h3>User Saticifaction / Apdex score:</h3>
      <ul>
        <p>Apdex is an industry standard to measure users' satisfaction with the response time of web applications and services. It's basically a simplified Service Level Agreement (SLA) solution that gives application owners better insight into how satisfied users are.”</p>
        <p>It works by specifying a goal for how long a specific webrequest or transaction should take. Those transactions are then bucketed in to saticified (fast), tolerating (sluggish), too slow and failed requests.</p>
        <p>A simple math formula is applied to provide a score from 0 to 1.</p>

      </ul>
    </div>

    <div class="">
      <h3>Average Response Time:</h3>
      <p>Average Response Time is the amount of time an application takes to return a request to a user.</p>
      <p>To measure Average Response Time, an application should be tested under different circumstances (i.e. number of concurrent users, number of transactions requested).</p>
    </div>


    <div class="">
      <h3>Error Rates:</h3>
      <p>There are potentially 3 different ways of to track applicaiton errors: <br>
            <span class="tabspace">HTTP Error % – Number of web requests that ended in an error</span> <br>
            <span class="tabspace">Logged Exceptions – Number of unhandled and logged errors from your application</<span> <br>
            <span class="tabspace">Thrown Exceptions – Number of all exceptions that have been thrown</<span>
       </p>
    </div>

    <div class="">
      <h3>Count of Application Instances:</h3>
      <p>how many server/application instances you have running (if your application is running in cloud with autosclalling enabled)</p>
      <p></p>
    </div>

    <div class="">
      <h3>Request Rate:</h3>
      <p>how much traffic your application receives will impact the success of your application?</p>
      <p>Request rates can be useful to correlate to other application performance metrics to understand the dynamics of how your application scales.</p>
      <p>Monitoring the request rate can also be good to watch for spikes or even inactivity. If you have a busy API that suddenly gets no traffic at all, that could be a really bad thing to watch out for.</p>
      <p>A similar but slightly different metric to track is the number of concurrent users. This is another interesting metric to track to see how it correlates.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="">
      <h3>Application & Server CPU:</h3>
    </div>

    <div class="">
      <h3>Application Availability:</h3>
      <p>Monitoring and measuring if your application is online and available is a key metric you should be tracking. Most companies use this as a way to measure uptime for service level agreements (SLA).</p>
      <p>If you have a web application, the easiest way to monitor application availability is via a simple scheduled HTTP check.</p>
      <p>Retrace can run these types of HTTP “ping” checks every minute for you. It can monitor response times, status codes, and even look for specific content on the page.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="">
      <h3>Garbage Collection:</h3>
      <p>When garbage collection occurs, it can cause your process to suspend and can use a lot of CPU.</p>
      <p>Garbage collection metrics may not be one of the first things you think about key application performance metrics. It can be a hidden performance problem that is always a good idea to keep an eye on.</p>
