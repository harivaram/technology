    <h1>Disaster Recovery, Migration and Transfer</h1>

    <h2>Disaster Recovery</h2>
    <div>
      <ul>
        <li>Any event that has a negative impact on a company's business conitinuity or finannce is a disaster.</li>
        <li>Disaster Recovery (DR) is about preparing for and recovering from a disaster.</li>
        <li>What kind of Disaster Recover? <br>
          - On-promise => On-promise: Traditional DR, and very expensive. <br>
          - On-promize => AWS Cloud: Hibrid recovery <br>
          - AWS Cloud Region A => AWS Cloud Region B 
        </li>
        <li>RPO (Recovery Point Objective): How much data loss a company can experience with a period most relavant to its business before significant harm occurs, from the point of a disruptive event to the last data backup. <br>
            How much data a company can tolerate losing during an unforseen event.
        </li>
        <li>RTO (Recovery Time Objective): Amount of time that application, system and process can be down without causing significant damage to the business and the time spent restoring the application and its data to resume normal business operations after a significant incident.</li>
      </ul>
    
      <h5>Disaster Recovery Strategies</h5>
      <ul>
        <li>Backup and Restore: (High RPO)</li>
        <li>Pilot Light: <br>
          - A small version of app is always running in the cloud. <br>
          - Useful for the critical core (pilot light) <br>
          - Very similar to Backup and Restore <br>
          - Faster than Backup and Restore as critical systems are already up.
        </li>
        <li>Warm Standby: <br>
          - Full system is up and running, but minimum size <br>
          - Upon disaster, we can scale to production load.
        </li>
        <li>Hot Site / Multi Site Approach: <br>
          - Very low RTO (minutes or seconds) - very expensive. <br>
          - Full production Scale is running AWS and On-promise. <br>
          - All AWS Multi Region.
        </li>
      </ul>

      <h5>Disaster Recovery Tips</h5>
      <ul>
        <li>Backup: <br>
          - EBS Snapshots, RDS automated Backups / Snapshots etc.. <br>
          - Regular pushes to S3 / S3 IA / Glacier, Lifecycle Policy, Cross Region Replication. <br>
          - From On-Promise : Snowball or Storage Gateway.
        </li>
        <li>High Availability: <br>
          - Use Route53 to migrate DNS over from Region to Region. <br>
          - RDS Multi-AZ, ElastiCache Multi-AZ, EFS, S3
          - Site-to-Site VPN as a recovery from  Direct Connect.
        </li>
        <li>Replication: <br>
          - RDS Replication (Cross Region), AWS Aurora + Global Databases. <br>
          - Database replication from on-promise to RDS.
          - Storage Gateway
        </li>
        <li>Automation: <br>
          - CloudFormation / Eleastic Beanstalk to re-create a whole new environment. <br>
          - Recover / Reboot EC2 instances with CloudWatch if alarms fail. <br>
          - AWS Lamda functions for customized automations. 
        </li>
        <li>Chaos: Netflix has a "Simian-army" randomly terminating EC2</li>
      </ul>
    </div>


    <h2 id="trfamily">AWS Transfer Family</h2>
    <div>
      <ul id="trfamilydetails">
        <li>AWS Transfer for SFTP</li>
        <li>AWS Transfer for FTPS</li>
        <li>AWS Transfer for FTP (Only within VPC)</li>
      </ul>
    </div>

    <h2 id="datasync">AWS Data Sync</h2>
    <div>
      <ul id="dsyncdetails">
        <li>Move large amout of data to and from <br>
          - On-premises - AWS, Other Cloud to AWS (NFS, SMB, HDFS, S3 API...) - needs agent. <br>
          - AWS to AWS (diffent storage services) - no agent needed.
        </li>
        <li>Can Synchronize to <br>
          - Amazon S3 (Any storage class - including Glcier) <br>
          - Amazon EFS <br>
          - Amazon FSx (Windows, Luster, NetApp, OpenZFS)
        </li>
        <li>Replication tasks can be scheduled hourly, daily, weekly.</li>
        <li>File permissions and metadata are preserved (NFS POSIX, SMB..)</li>
        <li>One agent task can use 10 Gbps, can setup bandwidth limit.</li>
      </ul>
    </div>

    <h2 id="dms">Database Migration Service (DMS)</h2>
    <div>
      <ul id="dmsdetails">
        <li>Quickly and securely migrate databases to AWS, resilient, self healing.</li>
        <li>The source database remains avaiailabel during the migration.</li>
        <li>Supports: <br>
          - Homogeneous migrations (ex: Oracle to Oracle) <br>
          - Heterogeneous migrations (ex: Microsoft SQL Serer to Aurora) 
        </li>
        <li>Contineous Data Replication using CDC</li>
        <li>You must create an EC2 instance to perform the replication tasks.</li>
        <li>DMS Sources: <br>
          - On-promise and EC2 instances databases: Oracle, MS SQL Server, MySQL, MariaDB, SAP, DB2 <br>
          - Azure: Azure SQL Database. <br>
          - Amazon RDS: all including Aurora. <br>
          - Amazon S3 <br>
          - Document DB
        </li>
        <li>DMS Targets: <br>
          - On-promises and EC2 instances database: Oracle, MS SQL Server, MySQL, MariaDB, PostgreSQL, SAP. <br>
          - Amazon RDS. <br>
          - Redshift, DynamoDB, S3 <br>
          - OpenSearch Service. <br>
          - Kenesis Data Streams. <br>
          - Apache Kafka. <br>
          - Document DB & Amazon Neptune <br>
          - Redis & Babelfish.
        </li>
        <li>Enable Mutli-AZ to provision and maitain a sycnhronously stand replica in a different AZ.  <br>
          Advantages: <br>
            - Provide Data Redundancy <br>
            - Eliminate I/O freeze. <br>
            - Minimize latency spikes.
        </li>
      </ul>

      <h5>AWS Schema Conversion Tool (SCT)</h5>
      <ul>
        <li>Convert your Database's schema from one engine to another. <br>
          Example OLTP: (SQL server/Oracle) to MySQL, PostgreSQL, Aurora. <br>
          EXample OLAP: (Teradata or Oracle) to Amazon Redshift.
        </li>
        <li>Prefer compute-intensive instances to optimize data conversions.</li>
        <li>You do not need to use SCT if you are migrating the same DB engine <br>
          Ex: On-Promise PostgreSQL => RDS PostgreSQL <br>
        </li>
      </ul>

      <h5>RDS & Aurora MySQL Migration</h5>
      <ul>
        <li>RDS MySQL to Aurora MySQL <br>
          - Option 1: DB snapshots from RDS MySQL restore as MySQL Aurora DB. <br>
          - Option 2: Create Aurora read replica from your RDS MySQL, and when replication lag is 0, promote it as its own DB cluster (can take time and cost).
        </li>
        <li>External MySQL to Aurora MySQL <br>
          - Option 1: Use Precona XtraBackup to create file backup in Amazon S3. Create an Aurora MySQL DB from Amazon S3. <br>
          - Opption 2: Create an Aurora MySQL DB. Use the mysqldump utility to migrate MySQL into Aurora (slower than S3 method.)
        </li>
        <li>Use DMS if both databases are up and running.</li>
      </ul>

      <h5>RDS & Aurora PostgreSQL Migration</h5>
      <ul>
        <li>RDS PostgreSQL to Aurora PostgreSQL <br>
          - Option 1: DB snapshots from RDS PostgreSQL restore as PostgreSQL Aurora DB. <br>
          - Option 2: Create Aurora read replica from your RDS PostgreSQL, and when replication lag is 0, promote it as its own DB cluster (can take time and cost).
        </li>
        <li>External PostgreSQL to Aurora PostgreSQL <br>
          - Create a backup and put it in Amazon S3, Import it using the aws_s3 Aurora extension.
        </li>
        <li>Use DMS if both databases are up and running.</li>
      </ul>
