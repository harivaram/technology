    <h1>Security, Identity and Compliance</h1>


    <h2 id="iam">Identity Access Management (IAM)</h2>
    <div id="iamdetails">
        <ul>
            <li>Global Service.</li>
            <li>Root account created by default, shouldn't be used or shared.</li>
            <li>Users are people within your organization, and can be grouped.</li>
            <li>Groups only contain users, not other groups.</li>
            <li>Users don't have to belong to a group, and user can belong to multiple groups.</li>
        </ul>

        <h5>IAM permissions</h5>
        <ul>
            <li>Users and Groups can be assigned Json documents called Policies. These policies define the permissions of the users.</li>
            <li>In AWS apply the least privilege principle.</li>
        </ul>
        <h5>IAM Policy Structure</h5>
        <ul>
            <li>Version: policy language version, always include "2012-10-17"</li>
            <li>Id: an identifier for the policy. (optional)</li>
            <li>Statement: one or more individual statements (required)</li>
            <li>Statement consists of <br>
                - Sid: an identifier for the statement (optional) <br>
                - Effect: whether the statement allows or denies access (Allow/Deny) <br>
                - Principal: account/user/role to which this policy applied to <br>
                - Action: list of actions this policy allows or denies <br>
                - Resources: list of resources to which the action applied to <br>
                - Condition: conditions for when this policy is in effect (optional).
            </li>
            <li>Create IAM Roles to give access permissions to AWS resources (Ex: EC2, Lamda, Cloud Formation etc).</li>
        </ul>
        <h5>Access AWS</h5>
        <ul>
            <li>User can access AWS in 3 ways <br>
                1. AWS Management Console (protected by password + MFA) <br>
                2. AWS Command Line Interface (CLI) : protected by access keys. <br>
                3. AWS Software Development Kit (SDK): for code: protected by access keys.
            </li>
            <li>Access keys are generated through AWS Management Console.</li>
            <li>Users manage their own access keys.</li>
            <li>Access key Id ~= Username &  Secret Access Key ~= password </li>
            <li>With AWS CLI, you can develop scripts to manage your resources.</li>
            <li>AWS CLI is built on AWS SDK for Phyton.</li>
        </ul>

        <h5>IAM Security Tools</h5>
        <ul>
            <li>IAM Credentials Report (account-level): lists all your account's users the status of their verious credentials.</li>
            <li>IAM Access Advisor (user-level) : shows permissions granted to a user and the last access details.</li>
        </ul>

        <h5>IAM Guidelines & Best Practices</h5>
        <ul>
            <li>Don't use root account except for AWS account setup.</li>
            <li>One physical user = One AWS user</li>
            <li>Assign users to group and assign permissions to groups.</li>
            <li>Create a strong password policy.</li>
            <li>Use and enforce the use of Multi Factor Authentication (MFA)</li>
            <li>Create and use Roles for giving pemrmissions to AWS services.</li>
            <li>Use Access keys for programmatic access (CLI/SDK)</li>
            <li>Audit permissions of you account using IAM Credentials Report & IAM Access advisor.</li>
            <li>Never share IAM users & Access keys.</li>
        </ul>

        <h5>IAM Conditions</h5>
        <ul>
            <li>aws:SourceIP -> restrcit the client IP from which the API calls are being made.</li>
            <li>aws:RestrictedRegions -> restric the region the API calls are made to.</li>
            <li>ec2:ResourceTag -> restrict based on tags</li>
            <li>aws:MultiFactorAuthPresent -> to force MFA</li>
        </ul>
        
        <h5>IAM for S3</h5>
        <ul>
            <li>Bucket level permissions <br>
                Ex: s3:ListBucket permission applies to arn:aws:S3:::test 
            </li>
            <li>Object level permissions <br>
                Ex: s3:GetObject, s3:PutObject, s3:DeleteObject applies to arn:aws:s3:::test/*
            </li>
        </ul>

        <h5>IAM Role Vs Resource-Based Policies</h5>
        <ul>
            <li>Cross Account Access: attaching a resource-based policy to a resource (ex: S3 bucket policy) OR using a role as proxy.</li>
            <li>When you assume a role (user, application or service), you give up your original permissions and take permission assigned to your role.</li>
            <li>When using resource-based policy, the principal doesn't have to give up his permissions.</li>
            <li>Supported by: S3 buckets, SNS topics, SQS queues etc...</li>
            <li>Ex: Amazon EventBridge - Sercurity <br>
                - When a rule runs, it needs permissions on the target. <br>
                - Resource-based policy: Lambda, SNS, SQS, CloudWatch Logs, API Gateway..... <br>
                - IAM role: Kenisis stream, Systems Manage Run Command, ECS task...
            </li>
        </ul>

        <h5>IAM Permission Boundaries</h5>
        <ul>
            <li>Supported by users and roles (not groups)</li>
            <li>Advanced featrue to use a managed policy to set maximum permissions an IAM entity can get.</li>
            <li>Can be used in combination of AWS Organizations SCP </li>
            <li>Use cases: <br>
                - Delegate responsibility to non administrators within their permission boundaries <br>
                - Allow developers to self-assign policies and manage their own permissions, while making sure they can't "escalate their privileges (= make themselves admin). <br>
                - Useful to restrict one specific user (instead of a whole account using Organizations & SCP)
            </li>
        </ul>

        <h5>IAM Plolicy Evaluation Logic</h5>
        <pre><code>
            if(any explicity Deny from any policies){
                "Deny" - explicit
            }else if((is pricipal's account a member of an organization with an applicable SCP) && (there is No Allow)) {
                "Deny" - implicit
            }else if((Does Requested resource have a resrouce-based policy) && (There is Allow)){
                "See the Resoure base policies section"
            }else if( principal have no identity based policy){
                "Deny"- implicit
            }else if(principal have identity based policy && there is no Allow){
                "Deny" - implicit
            }else if(Priciple has permission boundary && there is no allow){
                "Deny" - implicit
            }else if(principal is a session principal & there is a session policy && there is no Allow){
                "Deny" - implicit
            }else if(principal is a session principal & there is no session policy && this is not a role session){
                "Deny" - implicit
            }else{
                "Ã„llow"
            }

            </li>
        </ul>

        <h5>KMS Keys Types:</h5>
        <ul>
            <li>KMS Keys is the new name for KMS Customer Master Key.</li>
            <li>Symmetric (AES-256 keys):
                - Single encryption key that is used to Encrypt and Decrypt <br>
                - AWS services that are integrated with KMS use Symmetric CMKs <br>
                - You never get access to KMS key unencrypted (must call KMS API to use)
            </li>
            <li>Asymetric (RSA & ECC Key pairs) <br>
                - Public (Encrypt) and Private Key (Decrypt) pair <br>
                - Used for Encrypt/Decrypt or Sign/Verify operations. <br>
                - The public key is downloadable, but can't access the Private Key unencrypted. <br>
                - Use cases: encryption ouside of AWS by users who can't call the KMS API.
            </li>
        </ul>
        
        <h5>Type of KMS Keys</h5>
        <ul>
            <li>AWS Owned keys (free): SSE-S3, SSE-SQS, SSE-DDB (default key)</li>
            <li>AWS Managed Keys : free (aws/service-name , example: aws/rds or aws/ebs)</li>
            <li>Customer managed keys created in KMS: $1 / month</li>
            <li>Customer managed keys imported (must be symmetric key) : $1 / month</li>
            <li>+ pay for API call to KMS ($0.03/10000 calls) </li>
        </ul>

        <h5>Automatic Key Rotation:</h5>
        <ul>
            <li>AWS-managed KMS Key: automatic every 1 year.</li>
            <li>Customer-managed KMS Key: (must be enabled) automatic every 1 year.</li>
            <li>Imported KMS Key: only manual rotation possible using alias.</li>
        </ul>

        <h5>KMS Key Policies</h5>
        <ul>
            <li>Control access to KMS keys, "similar" to S3 bucket policies.</li>
            <li>Difference: you cannot control access without them.</li>
            <li>Default KMS Key Policy: <br>
                - Created if you don't provide a specific KMS Key Policy. <br>
                - Complete access to the key to the root account = entire AWS account.
            </li>
            <li>Custom KMS Key Policy: <br>
                - Define users, roles that can access the KMS key. <br>
                - Define who can administer the key. <br>
                - Useful for cross-account access of you KMS key.

        </ul>

        <h5>KMS Multi-Region Keys</h5>
        <ul>
            <li>Identical KMS keys in different AWS Regions that can be used interchangably.</li>
            <li>Multi-Region keys have the same key ID, key material, automatic rotation.</li>
            <li>Encrypt in one Region and decrypt in other Region.</li>
            <li>No need to re-encrypt or making cross-region API calls</li>
            <li>KMS Multi-Region are NOT global (Primary + Replicas)</li>
            <li>Each Multi-Region key is managed idependenlty.</li>
            <li>Use cases: gobal client-side encryption, encryption on Global DynamoDB, Global Aurora.</li>
        </ul>

        <h5>DynamoDB Global Tables and KMS Multi-Region Keys Client-Side encryption</h5>
        <ul>
            <li>We can encrypt specific attributes client-side in our DynamoDB table using the Amazon DynamoDB Encryption Client.</li>
            <li>Combined with Global Tables, the clinet-side encrypted data is replicated to other regions.</li>
            <li>If we use a multi-region key, replicateed in the same region as the DynamoDB Global table, then clients in these regions can use low latency API calls to KMS in their region to decrypt the data client-side.</li>
            <li>Using client-side encryption we can protect secific fields and guarantee only decryption if the client has access to an API key</li>
        </ul>

        <h5>S3 Replication Encryption Considerations</h5>
        <ul>
            <li>Unencrypted objects and objects encrypted with SSE-S3 are replicated by default.</li>
            <li>Objects encrypted with SSE-C (customer provided key) are never replicated.</li>
            <li>For objects encrypted with SSE-KMS, you need to enable the option <br>
                - Specify which KMS key to encrypt the objects within the target bucket. <br>
                - Adapt the KMS Key Policy for the target key <br>
                - An IAM Role with kms:Decrypt for the source KMS Key and kms:Encrypt for the target KMS Key. <br>
                - You might get KMS throttling errors, in which case you can ask for a Service Quotas increase.
            </li>
            <li>You can use multi-region AWS KMS keys, but they are currently treated as independent keys by Amazon S3 (the object will still be decrypted and then encrypted)</li>
        </ul>

        <h5>AMI Sharing Process Encrypted via KMS</h5>
        <ol>
            <li>AMI in source account is encrypted with KMS key from Source account</li>
            <li>Must modify the image attribute to add a Launch Permission which corresponds to the specific target AWS account. </li>
            <li>Must share AMS keys used to encrypt the snapshot the AMI refereces with target account /  IAL Role.</li>
            <li>The IAM Role / User in the target account must have the permissions to DecryptKey, ReEncrypted, CreateGrant, Decrypt</li>
            <li>When lanching an EC2 instance from the AMI, optionally the target account can specify a new KMS key in its own account to re-encrypt the volume.</li>
