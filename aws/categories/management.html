    <h1>Management and Governing</h1>
 
    <h2 id="elb">AWS Auto-scalling</h2>
    <div id="elbdetails">
      <ul>
        <li>Create and get rid of the servers very quickly to match the load.</li>
        <li>Ensure we have minimum and maximum number of EC2 instances running.</li>
        <li>Automatically register new instances to load balancer.</li>
        <li>Re-create an EC2 instance in case a previous one is terminated. (ex:if unhealthy)</li>
        <li>ASG (Auto scaling Group) are free. You only pay for the underying EC2 instances.</li>
      </ul>
      <h5>Auto Scalling Group Attributes</h5>
      <ul>
        <li>A Launch Template (Older "Lauch Configuration" are deperecated)
            <ul>
                <li>AMI + Instance Type</li>
                <li>EC2 User Data</li>
                <li>EBS Volumes</li>
                <li>Security Groups</li>
                <li>SSH Key Pair</li>
                <li>IAM roles for EC2 Instances</li>

                <li>Load Balancer Information</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
        <li>Min Size, Max Size, Initial Capacity.</li>
        <li>Scalling Policy.</li>
      </ul>
      <h5>Auto Scaling - Cloud Watch Alarms & Scalling</h5>
      <ul>
        <li>An Alarm monitors a metric (such as Average CPU, or a custom metric)</li>
        <li>Metrics such as Average CPU are computed for the overall ASG Instances.</li>
      </ul>
      <h5>Automatic Scalling Group - Dynamic Scalling Policies</h5>
      <ul>
        <li>Target Tracking Scalling: Most simple and easy to use. (Ex: Average ASG CPU to stay at around 40%)</li>
        <li>Simple/Step Scalling : Conditional scalling Ex: Add 2 units when CPU > 70%, remove 1 if CPU less than 30%.</li>
        <li>Scheduled Actions: Anticipate scalling based on known usage patterns EX: increase the min  capacity to 10 at 5pm on Fridays.</li>
        <li>Predictive scalling: contineously forcast load and schedlue scalling ahead.</li>
      </ul>
      <h5>Good metrics to scale on</h5>
      <ul>
        <li>CPU Utilization</li>
        <li>RequestCountPerTarget</li>
        <li>Average Network In/Out</li>
        <li>Any custom metric</li>
      </ul>
      <h5>Scalling Cooldowns</h5>
      <ul>
        <li>After a scalling activity happens ASG will not take any action for certain time (Cool down period). Default 300 sec</li>
        <li>Use ready-to-use AMI to reduce configuration time in order to be serving request faster and reduce cooldown period.</li>
      </ul>

          - Can save queries and add them to CloudWatch Dashboards
        </li>
        <li>Can query multiple Log Groups in different AWS accounts.</li>

      <ul>
        <li>By default, no logs from EC2 machine will go to CloudWatch.</li>
        <li>You need to run a CloudWatch agent on EC2 to push the log files you want.</li>
        <li>Meke sure IAM permissions are correct.</li>
        <li>The CloudWatch log agen can be setup on-promises too.</li>
      </ul>

      <h5>CloudWatch Logs Agent & Unified Agent</h5>
      <ul>
        <li>CloudWatch Logs Agent: <br>
          - Old version of the agent <br>
          - Can only send to CloudWatch logs.
        </li>
        <li>
          CloudWatch Unified Agent: <br>
          - Collect additional system-level metrics such as RAM, processes etc <br>
          - Collect logs to send to CloudWatch Logs. <br>
          - Centralized configuration using SSM Parameter Store.
        </li>

        </li>
        <li>Composit Alarms: <br>
          - CloudWatch Alarms are on a single metric <br>
          - Composit Alarms are monitoring the state of multiple other alarms. (AND and OR conditions). <br>
          - Helpful to reduce "alarm noise" by creating complex composit alarms. 
        </li>
        <li>Alarms can be created based on CloudWatch Log Metrics Filters.</li>
        <li>To test Alarms set Alarm state to "ALARM" with AWS CLI</li>
      </ul>

          - The total number of unique contributors, and their usage. 
        </li>
        <li>This helps to find top talkers and understand who or what is impacting system performance.</li>
        <li>Works for any AWS-generated logs (VPC, DNS, etc..)</li>
        <li>For example, you can find the bad hosts, identify the heaviest network users, or find the URL that generate the most errors.</li>
        <li>You can build your rules from scratch, or you can also use sample rules that AWS has created - leverages your CloudWatch Logs.</li>

                Configring rules for a routing data (Amazon EC2 CreateSubnet) <br>
                Setting up logging (AWS CloudTrail CreateTrail) <br>
          - By default, trails are configured to log management events. <br>
          - Can seperate Read Events from Write Events.
        </li>
        <li>Data Events: <br>
          - By default, date events are not logged (because high volume operations) <br>
          - Amazon S3 object-level activity (can separate Readn and Write Events) <br>
          - AWS Lambda function execuiton activity (the Invoke API)

          - Bursts of AWS IAM actions <br>
          - Gaps in periodic maintenance activity.
        </li>
        <li>CloudTrail insights analyze normal management events to create a baseline. And then contineously analyze write events to detect unusal patterns <br>
          - Anomalies appear in the CloudTrail console. <br>
          - Event is sent to Amazon S3 <br>
          - An EventBridge event is generated (for automated needs)
        </li>
      </ul>

      <h5>CloudTrial Event Retention</h5>
      <ul>
        <li>Events are stored for 90 days in CloudTrail.</li>

        <li>Infrastructure as code <br>
          - No resources are manually created, which is excellent for control. <br>
          - Changes to the infrastructure are reviewed through code.
        </li>
        <li>Cost: <br>
          - East resource within the stack is tagged with an identifier so you can easily see how much a stack costs you. <br>
          - You can estimate the cost of your resources using the CloudFormation template. <br>
          - Savings strategy: In Dev, you could automatically delete the resources with template at 5PM and recreate them at 8AM, safely. 
        </li>
