          While each organization experiences a unique journey to the cloud with numerous benefits, six advantages become aparant time and time again. Understanding these advantages allows architects to shape solutions that delivers contineous benefits to the organizations.
        </p>
        <p>
          AWS provides a highly available technology infrastructure platform with mulitiple locations worldwide. These locations are composed of regions and Availability Zones. <br>
          This enables organizations to place resources and data in multiple locations around the globe.
          Helping to protect the confidenciality, Integrity, and availability of systems and data of the utmost importance to AWS, as is maintaining the trust and confidence of the organizations around the world. <br>
        </p>

        <p>
          AWS offers a broad set of global compute, storage, database, analytics, application, and deployment services that help organizations move faster, lower IT cost, and scale applications. <br>
          Having a broad understanding of these services allows solution architects to design effective distributed applications and systems on AWS platforms.

      <h3>2. Amazon Simple Storage Service (Amazon S3) and Amazon Glacier Storage</h3>
      <p>Amazon S3 is core object storage service on AWS, allowing you to store an unlimitted amount of data with very high durability.</p>
      <p>Common Amazon S3 use cases include backup and archive, web content, big data analytics, static website hosting, mobile and cloud native application hosting and disaster recovery.</p>
      <p>Amazon S3 integrated with many other AWS cloud services, including AWS IAM, AWS KMS, Amazon EC2, Amazon EBS, Amazon EMR, Amazon DynamoDB, Amazon Redshift, Amazon SQS, Amazon Lambda, and Amazon Cloud Front.</p>
      <p>Object storage differs from traditional block and file storage. Block storage manages data at a device level addressible blocks, while file storage manages data at the operating system level files and folders. <br>
        Object storage manages data as objects that contain both data and metadata, manupulated by an API.
      </p>
      <p>Amazon S3 buckets are containers for objects stored in Amazon S3, Bucket names must be globally unique. Each bucket is created in a specific region, and data doen't leave the region unless explicitly copied by the user.</p>
      <p>Amazon S3 objects are files stored in buckets. Objects can be up to 5TB and can contain any kind of data. Objects contain both data and metadata and are identified by keys. Each amazon S3 bucket is can be addressed by unique URL formed by the webservices endpoint, the bucket name, and object key.</p>
      <p>Amazon S3 has minimalistic API - create/delete a bucket, read/write/delete objects, list keys in bucket - and uses a REST interface based on standard HTTP verbs - GET,PUT,POST and DELETE. <br>
        You can also use SDK wrapper libraries, the AWS CLI, and the AWS Management Console to work with Amazon S3.
      </p>
      <p>Amazon S3 is highly durable and highly available, designed for 11 nines of durability of objects in a given year and four nines of availability.</p>
      <p>Amazon S3 is eventually consistent, but offers read-after-write for new object PUTs. </p>
      <p>Amazon S3 objects are private by default, accessible only to the owners. Objects can be marked public readable to make them accessible on the web. Controlled access may be provided to others using ACLs and AWS IAM and Amazon S3 bucket policies. </p>
      <p>Static websites can be hosted in an Amazon S3 bucket.</p>
      <p>Prefixes and delimiters may be used in key names to organize and navigate data hierachically much like a traditional file system.</p>
      <p>Amazon S3 offers serveral storage classes suited for different usecases.<br>
         Standard is desinged for general purpose and needing high performance and low latency <br>
         Standard IA  is for less frequently accessed data. <br>
         RRS offfers lower redundancy at lower cost for easily reproduced data <br>
         Amazon Glacier offers low-cost durable storage for archive and long-term backups that can are rearly accessed and can accept a three to five hour retrieval time.
      </p>
      <p>Object life cycle management policies can be used to automatically move data between storage classes based on time.</p>
      <p>Amazon S3 data can be encrypted using server-side or client-side encryption, and encryption keys can be managed with Amazon KMS.</p>
      <p>Versioning and MFA delete can be used to protect against accidental deletion.</p>
      <p>Cross-region replication can be used to automatically copy new objects from a source bucket in one region to target bucket in another region.</p>
      <p>Pre-signed URLs grant time-limited permission to download objects and can be used to protect media and other webcontent from unauthorized "web scraping".</p>
      <p>Multipart upload can be used to upload large objects, and Range GET can be used to download options of an amazon S3 object or Amazon Glacier archive.</p>
      <p>Server access logs can be enabled on a bucket to track requestor, object, action, and response.</p>
      <p>Amazon S3 event notifications can be used to send an Amazon SQS or Amazon SNS message or to trigger an AWS Lambda function where an object is created or deleted.</p>
      <p>Amazon Glacier can be used as a standalone serivce or as a storage class in Amazon S3.</p>
      <p>Amazon Glacier stores data in achives, which are contained in vaults. You can have up to 1,000 vaults, and each vault can store an unlimted number of archives.</p>
      <p>Amazon Glacier valuts can be locked for compliance purposes.</p>

      <h3>3. Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud (Amazon EC2) and Amazon Elastic Block Store (Amazon EBS)</h3>
      <p>Compute is the amount of computational power required to fullfill your workload. Amazon EC2 is the primary service to provide compute to customers.</p>
      <p>The instance type defines the virtual hardware supporting the instance. Available instance types vary in vCPUs, memory, storage, and network performance to address nearly any workload.</p>
      <p>An AMI defines the initial software state of the instance, both OS and applications. There are four sources of emphasis <br>
        AWS published generic OSs <br>
        Partner published AMIs in the AWS market place with software packages preinstalled. <br>
        Custom generated AMIs from existing Amazon EC2 instances, and uploaded AMIs from vitual servers. <br>
      </p>
      <p>Instances can be addressed by public DNS name, public IP address, or elastic IP address. <br>
        To access a newly launched Linux instance, use private half of the key pair to contact to the instance via SSH. <br>
        To access a newly created Windows instance, use private half of the key pair to decrypt the randomly initialized local admistrator password <br>
      </p>
      <p>Network traffic in and out of an instance can be controlled by virtual firewall called security group.
        A secuirty group allows rules that block traffic based on direction, port, protocol, and source/destination address.
      </p>
      <p>Bootstrapping allows you to run a script to initialize your instance with OS configurations and applications. This feature allows instance to configure themselves upon launch. <br>
        Once an instance is launched, you can change your instance type or, of Amazon VPC instances, the security group with which it is associated. <br>
      </p>

      <p>The three pricing options for instances are On-Demand, Reserved Instance, and Spot. <br>
        On-Demand has highest  per hour cost, requiring no up-front commitment and giving you complete control over the lifetime of the instance. <br>
        Reserved Instances require a commitment and provided a reduced overall cost over the lifetime of the reservation. <br>
        Spot instances are idle compute capacity that AWS makes available based on bid prices from customers. <br>
        The savings on per hour cost can be significant, but instances can be shutdown when bid price exceeds customer's current bid.
      </p>

      <p>Instance stores are block storage included with hourly cost of the instance. The amount and type of storage available varies with the instance type. <br>
        Instance store terminate when the associated instance is stopped, so they should only be used for temporary data or in architectures providing redundancy such as Hadoop's HDFS.
      </p>
      <p>
        Amazon EBS provides durable block storage in several types. <br>
        Magnetic has low cost per gigabyte and delivers modest performance. <br>
        General purpose SSD is cost-effective storage that can be provided up to 10,000 IOPS. <br>
        Provisioned IOPS SSD has the highest cost per gigabyte and is well suited for I/O-intensive workloads sensitive to storage performace. <br>
        Snapshots are incremental backups of Amazon EBS volumes store in Amazon S3. Amazon EBS volumes can be encrypted.
