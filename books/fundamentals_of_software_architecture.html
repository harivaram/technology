        <h2>Introduction</h2>
        <ul>
            <li><i>"Architecture is about the important stuff... Whatever that is."</i> _ Ralph Johnson</li>
            <li><a href="https://martinfowler.com/ieeeSoftware/whoNeedsArchitect.pdf">Who needs an Architect</a></li>
            <li>"Software Architecure is about making fundamental structural choices which are costly to change once implemented.". But It is no longer expensive to make structural changes in microservices.</li>
            <li>Architecture like much  art, it can only be understood in context. Many of the decisions architects made were based on realities of the environment they found themselves in.</li>
            <li>Softwared Architecture consists of the structure of the system (denoted as the heavy black lines supporting the architecture), combined with architecture characteristics ("-ilities") the system must support, architecture decisions, and finally design principles.</li>
            <li>Structure refers to the type of architecture style used in the system.</li>
            <li>Architecture characteristics refers to the "-ilities" that the system must support.</li>
            <li>Architecture decisions are rules for constructing systems.</li>
            <li>Design priciples are guidelines for constructing systems.</li>
            <li>Expectations of an Architect
                <ol>
                    <li>Make architecture decisions: <br>
                        <i>An achitect is exprected to define the architecture decisions and design pricniples used to guide technology decisions whithin the team, the department or across the enterprise.</i>
                    </li>
                    <li>Continually analyze the architecture: <br>
                        <i>An Architect is expected to continually analyze the architecture and current technology environment and then recommend solutions for improvement.</i>
                    </li>
                    <li>Keep current with latest trends: <br>
                        <i>An architect is expected to keep current with the latest technology and industry trends.</i>
                    </li>
                    <li>Ensure compliance with decisions: <br>
                        <i>An architect is expected to ensure compliance with architecture decisions and design principles.</i>
                    </li>
                    <li>Diverse exposure and experience: <br>
                        <i>An architect is expected to have exposure to multiple and diverse technologies, frameworks, platforms and environments.</i>
                    </li>
                    <li>Have business domain knowledge: <br>
                        <i>An architect is expected to have a certain level of business domain expertise.</i>
                    </li>
                    <li>Posess interpersonal skills: <br>
                        <i>An architect is expected to posses exceptional interpersonal skills, including teamwork, facilitation and leadership.</i> <br>
                        <i>"no matter what they tell you, it's always a people problem."</i>_ Garalad Weingberg.
                    </li>
                    <li>Understand and navigate politics: <br>
                        <i>An architect is expected to understand political climate of the enterprise and be able to navigage the politics.</i>
                    </li>
                </ol>
            </li>
            <li>
                <i>"...because as we know, there are known knowns; there are things we know we know. We also know there are known unknowns; that is to say we know there are some things we do not know. But there are also unkonwn unknowns - the ones we don't know we don't know."</i> _ Former United States Secretary of Defense Donald Rumsfeld.
            </li>
            <li>All architectures become iterative because of unknown unkonwns. Agile just recognizes this and does it sooner.</li>
            <li>Laws of Software Architecture:
                <ul>
                    <li><i>"Everything in software architecture is a trade-off"</i> _ First Law of Software Architecture.</li>
                    <li><i>If an architect thinks they  have discovered something that isn't a trade-off, more likely they just haven't identified the trade-off yet.</i> - Crollary 1</li>
                    <li><i>"Why" is important than "How". </i> _ Second Law of Software Architecture.</li>
                </ul>
